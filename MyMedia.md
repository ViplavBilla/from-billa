I completed a book called half girlfriend recently. It is written by Chetan Bhagat. It is a good book about a student falling in love with a girl, how he achieve his goals and about his journey. 

The book is about a boy from small village join a prestigious college dreaming to develop his village.
In the college he fell in love with a girl. It is also adapted into the movies.
